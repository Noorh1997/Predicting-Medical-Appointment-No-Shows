# Predicting-Medical-Appointment-No-Shows

# Medical Appointment No-Shows: Data Scientist Capstone Project

## Introduction
This project analyzes a dataset of medical appointments to understand the factors influencing patient attendance. The goal is to predict no-shows and identify the most significant factors affecting patient attendance.

## Files in the Repository
- `notebook.ipynb`: Project code including data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, model implementation, and results.
- `No-show appointments.csv`: Dataset used for the project.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and overview.
- `blog_post.md`: Draft of the Medium blog post detailing the project.

## Summary of Results
- **Data Cleaning and Exploration**: Cleaned data by converting dates, dropping unnecessary columns, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Data Visualization**: Plotted distributions and correlations to understand data characteristics.
- **Model Implementation**: Implemented Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.
- **Evaluation**: Logistic Regression had an accuracy of 79.99% but failed to predict no-shows. Random Forest had an accuracy of 76.60%, with better prediction for no-shows.
- **Feature Importance**: Age was the most significant predictor of no-shows.
